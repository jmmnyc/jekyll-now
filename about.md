My name is Jose.  As many others I both fell into and fell in love with data.

I've been writing SQL, performing analysis, creating visuals and communicating insights from data for over 10 years. 

### More Information

Although I've learned a lot I know there's still more out there, but at the same time I want to make sure I share what I know with other aspiring data enthusiasts.
